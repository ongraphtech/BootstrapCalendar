	"description": "is SMUD’s intention to undertake a thorough renovation of their Headquarters Building located at 6201 S Street in Sacramento, California. The Headquarters Building has served as SMUD’s district headquarters since construction was completed in 1959. SMUD considers the building to be significant to their brand and image and desires to renovate the building to support continued use for the foreseeable future. The Headquarters building is divided into three sections: south wing, core and north wing. The south wing is four levels above grade with a full floor below grade; the core is five levels above grade and one floor below grade. The north wing has three parking levels and a two story office portion above the parking garage. The project will entail a complete renovation of the 120,000 square foot office and 45,000 square foot parking garage that makes up the complete Headquarters Building. The Headquarters Building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009 as an excellent example of Modern International Style. Supporting historic preservation and the renovation objectives, the renovation will follow the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of historic Properties, Standards for Rehabilitation. This standard has been adopted by the City of Sacramento as the guideline for historic renovations. The HQ renovation design team will be required to interface and coordinate with the City of Sacramento and the State Office of Historic Preservation (OHP). The design team is to be familiar with and responsible for all documentation and supporting elements to produce a renovation design that will be acceptable to OHP and all stakeholders.",
